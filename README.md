# Student_Mental_Health
I worked on a project Student mental health . This Data set was collected by a survey conducted by Google forms from University students in order to examine their current academic situation and mental health.
In this project I fill finding whther the students have panic attack or not . 
Firstly, i did the Visualisations for better understanding of data and the i did EDA (cleaning and one-hot encoding) and after that i evaluated the model and finally i get that knn is permorming best as compared to other classifiers (decision tree and randomforest)
